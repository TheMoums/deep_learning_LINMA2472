Xavier thought the meeting was today that I've made it with him face to face.
Here is what I've noted down :
- Drag and drop : He thinks it's quite important for the client so he wants us to do it.
- Student vew : We need to limit the scroll view with a little '+' button that displays the rest of the tree
- ORM : Not mandatory but relevant to put a modified version of it in the report
- Mockups : Old mockups 'useless', we have to show real screenshot of the website (already done)
- Modules : We have to mention where each important function is located in the code
- Tests : Worth a lot of points. Explain if tests are branch or line coverage.
- Sequence diagram : Only show interesting situation (not a login).
